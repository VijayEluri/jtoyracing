About JToyRacing

JToyRacing is a demo game that Iâ€™ve made for my postgraduate degree. The key point was to show how to make a game using Java and a game engine, it runs on top of jMonkeyEngine.

Although the game doesn't have objectives at the moment, it is playable. There are two checkpoints in the race track that restore the vehicle's health.

Since I am a developer and not an expert in 3D modeling or image manipulation, I had to get the files to use in the game from the Internet. The 3D models and textures I got from http://www.turbosquid.com, very good repository of both free and paid files.
