JToyRacing is a demo game that runs on top of jMonkeyEngine. Although the game doesn't have objectives at the moment, it is playable. There are two checkpoints in the race track that restore the vehicle's health.

The 3D models and textures are from http://www.turbosquid.com, a very good repository of both free and paid files.
